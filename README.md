We'll be using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to manage our environments for this project.
This will make sure we are all using the same env during development. 
The information for getting started and fine tuning pre-trained models can be found on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/training)
Go to [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and sign up to get an API key for a developer. I plan to email the company to see if I can get student access.
